# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a system from running many different containers over multiple different machines

It is used when we need to run many different containers with different images

miniKube is used for development ONLY, it sets up a small cluster on your local machine

In production we would use a managed solution such as Amazon Elastic Container service for Kubernetes (EKS) or Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

kubeCTL is used to manage the minikube virtual machine or to manage a production solution

Steps to setup local kubernetes development environment
Install KubeCTL
Install virtualBox, a Virtual Machine driver
Install miniKube
